Place your Resume PDF here to enable the "Download Resume" button:

- Filename: Resume.pdf
- Path: public/Resume.pdf

After adding the file, restart the dev server if needed:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The "Download Resume" button on the site links to `/Resume.pdf` and will download the file when present.
